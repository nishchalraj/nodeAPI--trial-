always make a note for the Routes, the database schema before starting to make any API.

for me only(learning purpose):
how i wrote the code (file wise):
1.server.js
2.app.js
3.api->routes->products.js
             ->orders.js
4.connect database(mongodb/mongoose) through the app.js
5.with the above step start doing Models for the (M(odels)V(view i.e. app.js)C(controllers i.e. routes) architeture)
6.connect the models to the controllers/routers
7.for every routes made configure the database actions with proper response to them
8.do authentication things such as signup and signin
